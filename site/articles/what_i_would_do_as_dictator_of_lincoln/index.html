		<p>Lincoln is a cathedral city situated in the East Midlands of England. It homes a beautiful city centre, many natural areas, and shares a pleasant mix of a bustling liveliness and a cozy tranquility. Having lived here since birth, I have little negative to say about it. However if I were given absolute power, there are some areas I would want to change...</p>

		<h2>Rebuilding the Spires</h2>

		<p>The Lincoln Cathedral is known for having been, at one point, the tallest building in the world. A main contributor to its height was a spire constructed at the start of the 14th century, which unfortunately collapsed during a storm in 1549. This spire along with 2 others that were removed, were never rebuilt. This has clearly been a big mistake by the leading powers of Lincoln, therefore I would 100% rebuild them.</p>

		<h2>Housing</h2>

		<p>The cost of housing is an issue throughout all of England, and it hasn't avoided Lincoln. The remedy to this problem is of course to build more homes. That being said, doing so has a high cost, both monetarily and in the space it uses up. That's why I've decided the most reasonable solution is building lots of Commie Blocs.

		<h2>Public Facilities</h2>
		
		<p>Despite there being quite a few lakes within the bounds of Lincoln. There aren't any outdoor places (to my knowledge) that are upkept for swimming, without paying some kind of membership fee. For the amount of clean lakes in the area, this is unacceptable and should change.</p>

		<h2>Tanks</h2>

		<p>Lincoln is famously the birthplace of the tank. This feat of engineering is commemorated by the tank memorial on Tritton Road. But why should we end it at that? Lincoln should strengthen its might, and begin military research and production so that a newer tank may be viewed as groundbreaking.</p>
